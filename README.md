## Experience

#### Senior Research Engineer -- Pratt & Whitney -- 2018-current
- senior-most software engineer supporting a group of ~75 researchers
- built a boilerplate stack (*`React.js`, `Flask`, `mysql` + `SQLAlchemy`, `gunicorn`, `nginx`*) that could be provisioned with `Ansible`, built out with all of the core features required for a web app to run on our enterprise network (*AuthN/AuthZ (LDAPs/JWT), Clientside Auth Flow, User Registration System, User Account Role Framework, User Admin Panel, SMTP integration, TLS certs for dev system, Systemd Services Configured, Reverse Proxy Configured, Backend and Frontend Scaffolding*)
- built six web applications using my boilerplate stack and trained another software engineer to build their own web apps using it.  All are critical to, or support, production processes.
- built two `electron.js` apps that support production processes
- used `Rust` with `pyo3` to alleviate performance bottlenecks in `python` libraries
- defined then managed release process for production software applications and libraries

#### Implementation Engineer -- Excel Medical Electronics -- 2016-2018
- managed implementation design and deployment of real-time data acquisition software systems for all hospital customers (~100) in Pacific, Mountain, and Central time zones
- worked software support rotation with other software engineers

#### Lab Manager -- University of Vermont -- 2014-2016
- managed laboratory daily operations for School of Engineering at University of Vermont
- helped students with senior engineering design projects, primarily providing assistance with software-related and HPC tasks

## Education

#### M.S. Materials Science -- University of Vermont -- 2014
Thesis: [Path Integral Quantum Monte Carlo Study of Coupling and Proximity Effects in Superfluid Helium-4](https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1298&context=graddis)

- worked with my team to develop path integral monte carlo `C++` application
- wrote `python` scripts to automate job submission and data retrieval/rollup for HPC clusters 

#### B.S. Interdisciplinary Mathematics // B.A. Physics // B.A. Chemistry -- University of North Carolina at Greensboro -- 2011
